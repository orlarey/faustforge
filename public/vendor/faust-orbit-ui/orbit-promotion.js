/**
 * PresetPromotionTracker — dwell-based auto-promotion (PRESETSPEC §
 * « Mémorisation »). Memorises a configuration as a preset once it has
 * held still long enough since the last gesture commit, gated by:
 *   • InGesture       (orbit-ui knows: pointer drag in flight)
 *   • OverlayActive   (orbit-ui knows: calque is open)
 *   • Suspended       (host-driven: audio not playing, effect bypassed)
 *
 * The tracker is pure state + decision logic. The host (OrbitUI) drives it:
 * `recordCommit` after each gesture, `evaluate` periodically, and the
 * three gate setters from the corresponding signals.
